# typewriter-effect
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to create a typewriter effect that truly magnifies the scope of websites and makes a more interesting UI. 

This segment of code focuses on the amilfication of website user interfaces by creating immersive animations that make your personal website or personal portfolio more intrguing to your visitors.

Through this project, I learnt how to interact with JavaScript and CSS to keyframe and make smooth animations to portray on an HTML website.
